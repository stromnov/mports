description         Distributed object middleware for Python (RPC)
long_description    \
    Pyro means PYthon Remote Objects. It is a library that \
    enables you to build applications in which objects can talk to each \
    other over the network, with minimal programming effort. You can just \
    use normal Python method calls, with almost every possible parameter and \
    return value type, and Pyro takes care of locating the right object on the \
    right computer to execute the method. It is designed to be very easy to \
    use, and to generally stay out of your way. But it also provides a set of \
    powerful features that enables you to build distributed applications \
    rapidly and effortlessly. Pyro is written in 100% pure Python.
